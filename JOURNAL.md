My JLCPCB total price:

## 11/9/2025 9:54 AM - 3D Printing for JLCPCB (in case i cant print at blueprint)  

I put my files from Autodesk Fusion 360 into JLCBCB to check how expensive it will be, I will use this if I am not able to print the file with Blueprint

*sigh*
_I'll have to design it again_
That's fine though, I'll customise it and resubmit

### Also
I changed the XIAO module to have pass-through holes instead of just a copper plate for more stability to solder, that took about 30min to insert the new module

  

## 11/10/2025 - Finished everything x2  

Finished everything!
(including the hackpad lid, which i dont know if it will fit or not since kicad and fusion dont really work well together... (ill add a screenshot of the lid anyway)
